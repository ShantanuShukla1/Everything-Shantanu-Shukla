      Bio
    </h1>

    <p> 
      My name is Shantanu Shukla, and I am a Virginia Tech student majoring in computer science. I plan on graduating by the summer of 2026. 
      I was born on April 4th, 2006. 
      I am a first-generation Indian American who grew up in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, with my Mom, Dad, Older Sister, and dog, as you can see in the image. 
      I attended Upper Moreland until I was around 10 years old and then moved to Chesterbrook, PA, to complete my schooling in the Treddyrfirin Easttown School District. 
      I graduated from Conestoga High School in May of 2024 and now am an excited CS student at Virginia Tech.

      Hobbies
    </h1>

    <p>
      Although I am curious about almost anything I see and can get my hands on, I have a few hobbies that keep my attention outside class. Since I was 9, I have been playing the alto saxophone and enjoy playing various jazz charts from my heroes like Charlie Parker and Cannonball Adderley. I have performed for multiple family gatherings and take any chance to snag a gig for myself. I have practiced martial arts (Tang Soo Do) for roughly 10 years, ages 5-10 and 13-18. I earned two black belts at the World and International Tang Soo Do associations, where I trained before and after moving, respectively. Additionally, I like to play chess
when I get the chance, both in person and online. Although I am not as active anymore, I spent a lot of my time in India playing against my relatives and friends, who were always a challenge.

      Interests
    </h1>

    <p>
      Growing up, a couple of things caught my interest and stayed with me until today and probably forever. For starters, I am a vegetarian Hindu and hope
to one day build a sanctuary for abused animals in both America and India. As a religious man who strongly believes in animal rights, I hope to one day make a difference 
for the many animals today who are abused in countries that don't have strongly enforced laws protecting them. I've also been interested in physics and space since childhood.
My father and I have always watched space probes and shuttles being launched into space, and I have studied physics and calculus since middle school. If I didn't find computer science
and systems even more fascinating, I would pursue a career as a physicist of some kind. I was physics club president at my high school and have tutored many students
in physics and programming both online and in person through the many volunteering organizations I was a part of.
